Program for solving odes using the odeint boost library. The program allows to
use different methods. For details look into "main.cpp". (The stiff solver might 
not be appropriate for bigger networks (more than ~50 species) as the calculation 
of the jacobi matrix in the current form gets to slow then!)

The program can be built using the accompanying makefile ("Makefile"). At the 
console (Linux / Unix) just type "make". If successfully compiled program can
be used by typing "./jrnf_int help" in the same directory. 

CAUTION: The code is affected from this bug in odeint (boost): https://github.com/headmyshoulder/odeint-v2/commit/31c29dd9486c78d1ec4c0eac7b95e7d34a21362e
If the stiff solver runs really slow this might be the fault. At the moment (Nov 2016) the fix is not in a boost release yet. So if a distribution did not patch it one has do do it themself.
